## Claude Telegram Supercharged

Drop-in upgrade for the official Claude Code Telegram plugin. Install once, get 15+ features the official plugin doesn't have. Built on top of the official plugin -- everything works, just better.

2 minutes to install. Zero config. Your existing bot and pairing keep working.

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **🎤 Voice Messages** | Talk to Claude. Whisper transcribes your voice messages server-side -- like Wispr Flow for Claude Code. Works from your phone while walking. |
| **🎤 Auto-transcribe in History** | ALL voice messages in group chats are transcribed, even without mentioning the bot. Claude has full context of what everyone said. Configurable via `autoTranscribe`. |
| **🧠 Conversation Memory** | `/clean` saves a summary before clearing. Memory persists across sessions. Claude never forgets what you talked about. |
| **💬 Message History** | SQLite-backed rolling store. Claude has context across restarts. `get_history` + `search_messages` tools. No more "what were we talking about?" |
| **🧵 Conversation Threading** | Claude follows reply chains in groups, sees who said what, responds in the correct thread. Up to 3 levels deep. |
| **📋 Forum Topics** | Telegram Forum topics fully supported. Each topic is isolated -- `thread_id` persists in SQLite across restarts. |
| **🎨 MarkdownV2 Formatting** | Bold, italic, code blocks, links render properly. `parse_mode` support (MarkdownV2/HTML/plain). |
| **🎯 Inline Buttons** | `ask_user` tool -- send questions with tappable buttons, wait for choice. Perfect for confirmations and approvals. |
| **😎 Sticker & GIF Support** | Claude actually sees stickers and GIFs. Static stickers as images, animated ones as multi-frame collages. |
| **👍 Reaction Status** | Visual processing status: 👀 read → 🔥 working → 👍 done. Plus expressive reactions for standout messages. |
| **✅ Reaction Validation** | Client-side emoji whitelist prevents cryptic Telegram API errors. |
| **👥 Group Pairing** | Add bot to group, mention it, get pairing code. No hunting for numeric chat IDs. |
| **🔒 Shell Injection Protection** | All subprocess calls use `spawnSync` with array args. No shell interpretation of file paths. |
| **🧹 Session Management** | `clear_history` + `save_memory` tools. Clean up with context preservation. |
| **📊 Smart Caching** | Voice/audio files cached between middleware and handlers. No double downloads, no double transcriptions. |

## Getting Started

> Default pairing flow for a single-user DM bot. See [ACCESS.md](./ACCESS.md) for groups and multi-user setups.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) -- the MCP server runs on Bun. Install with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.

### 1. Create a bot with BotFather

Open a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and send `/newbot`. BotFather asks for two things:

- **Name** -- the display name shown in chat headers (anything, can contain spaces)
- **Username** -- a unique handle ending in `bot` (e.g. `my_assistant_bot`). This becomes your bot's link: `t.me/my_assistant_bot`.

BotFather replies with a token that looks like `123456789:AAHfiqksKZ8...` -- that's the whole token, copy it including the leading number and colon.

### 2. Install the [official plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/external_plugins/telegram)

These are Claude Code commands -- run `claude` to start a session first.

```
/plugin install telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

### 3. Apply the supercharged version

Clone this repo and replace the official plugin's server with the supercharged one:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/k1p1l0/claude-telegram-supercharged.git
cp claude-telegram-supercharged/server.ts ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/telegram/0.0.1/server.ts
```

### 4. Give the server the token

```
/telegram:configure 123456789:AAHfiqksKZ8...
```

Writes `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...` to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/.env`. You can also write that file by hand, or set the variable in your shell environment -- shell takes precedence.

### 5. Relaunch with the channel flag

The server won't connect without this -- exit your session and start a new one:

```sh
claude --channels plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

### 6. Pair

With Claude Code running from the previous step, DM your bot on Telegram -- it replies with a 6-character pairing code. If the bot doesn't respond, make sure your session is running with `--channels`. In your Claude Code session:

```
/telegram:access pair <code>
```

Your next DM reaches the assistant.

> Unlike Discord, there's no server invite step -- Telegram bots accept DMs immediately. Pairing handles the user-ID lookup so you never touch numeric IDs.

### 7. Lock it down

Pairing is for capturing IDs. Once you're in, switch to `allowlist` so strangers don't get pairing-code replies. Ask Claude to do it, or `/telegram:access policy allowlist` directly.

### Updating

When the official plugin updates, re-apply the supercharged server:

```sh
cd claude-telegram-supercharged
git pull
cp server.ts ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/telegram/0.0.1/server.ts
```

Then restart your Claude Code session.

## Tools Exposed to the Assistant

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `reply` | Send to a chat. Takes `chat_id` + `text`, optionally `reply_to` (message ID) for native threading, `files` (absolute paths) for attachments, and `parse_mode` (MarkdownV2/HTML/plain, defaults to MarkdownV2). Images (`.jpg`/`.png`/`.gif`/`.webp`) send as photos with inline preview; other types send as documents. Max 50MB each. Auto-chunks text; files send as separate messages after the text. Returns the sent message ID(s). |
| `react` | Add an emoji reaction to a message by ID. **Only Telegram's fixed whitelist** is accepted (👍 👎 ❤ 🔥 👀 🎉 😂 🤔 etc). Also used for status indicators (👀 read → 👍 done). |
| `edit_message` | Edit a message the bot previously sent. Supports `parse_mode` (MarkdownV2/HTML/plain). Useful for "working..." → result progress updates. Only works on the bot's own messages. |
| `ask_user` | Send a question with inline keyboard buttons and wait for the user's choice. Takes `chat_id`, `text`, `buttons` (array of labels), optional `parse_mode` and `timeout` (default 120s). Returns the label of the tapped button. |
| `get_history` | Retrieve recent message history from a chat. Takes `chat_id`, optional `limit` (default 50, max 200), optional `before` (unix timestamp for pagination). Returns formatted messages with timestamps, senders, and content. |
| `search_messages` | Search message history by text pattern. Takes `chat_id`, `query` (substring match), optional `limit` (default 20, max 100). Returns matching messages. |
| `clear_history` | Clear all message history for a chat. Always confirm with `ask_user` first, and call `save_memory` before clearing to preserve context. |
| `save_memory` | Save a conversation summary to persistent memory. Loaded into Claude's instructions on every startup. Use before `clear_history` so context survives across sessions. |

### Inbound Events

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Text message | Forwarded to Claude as a channel notification with `chat_id`, `message_id`, `user`, `ts`. |
| Photo | Downloaded to inbox, path included in notification so Claude can `Read` it. |
| Emoji reaction | When a user reacts to a bot message, Claude receives a notification with `event_type: "reaction"`, the emoji, and the `message_id`. Use as lightweight feedback. |
| Voice message | Downloaded to inbox as `.ogg`, auto-transcribed by the server if whisper is installed. Transcription replaces "(voice message)" in the notification text. Audio path still included as `audio_path`. |
| Audio file | Forwarded audio files (`.mp3`, etc.) downloaded to inbox, path included as `audio_path`. |
| Sticker | Static `.webp` passed directly as `image_path`. Animated (`.tgs`) and video (`.webm`) stickers converted to multi-frame collage. Emoji and pack name included in text. |
| GIF / Animation | Downloaded and converted to a multi-frame horizontal collage so Claude can see the animation content. |

Inbound messages trigger a typing indicator automatically -- Telegram shows "botname is typing..." while the assistant works on a response.

## Voice & Audio Messages

Voice messages and audio files are downloaded to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/inbox/` and automatically transcribed by the server. The transcription text replaces "(voice message)" in the notification, so Claude receives the spoken text directly.

Think of it as **Wispr Flow for Claude Code**. Open Telegram, hold the mic button, say "refactor the auth middleware to use JWT" -- Claude gets that as text and starts working. No typing, no desktop app needed, works from your phone.

### Transcription Setup

The server auto-detects which whisper binary is available (checked once at startup):

1. **[whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp)** (recommended) -- `brew install whisper-cpp`. Fast C++ port, runs fully offline. Requires a model file:
   ```sh
   # Download the small multilingual model (465MB, good quality/speed balance)
   mkdir -p /usr/local/share/whisper-cpp/models
   curl -L -o /usr/local/share/whisper-cpp/models/ggml-small.bin \
     "https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-small.bin"
   ```
2. **[openai-whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)** (fallback) -- `pip install openai-whisper`. Python-based, slower but also works offline.
3. **No whisper** -- voice messages are still downloaded and the `audio_path` is included in the notification, but no transcription is provided. Claude will suggest installing whisper.

Both options require **ffmpeg** (`brew install ffmpeg`) for audio format conversion.

### Auto-transcription in history

When `autoTranscribe` is enabled (the default), the server transcribes **all** voice/audio messages in group chats -- even ones that don't mention the bot. This means `get_history` and the auto-injected context always show the spoken text (prefixed with 🎤) instead of `[voice]`. Claude gets full conversational context including what people said in voice messages.

To disable (e.g. to save CPU on busy groups):

```sh
/telegram:access set autoTranscribe false
```

To re-enable:

```sh
/telegram:access set autoTranscribe true
```

## Conversation Memory

When you clear chat history, Claude first saves a short summary to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/data/memory.md`. This file is loaded into Claude's instructions on every startup -- so context from previous sessions is never fully lost.

- Summaries are dated and tagged with the chat ID
- File auto-compresses when it exceeds 10,000 characters (older half gets trimmed)
- Works across `/clear` and Claude Code restarts

## Group Chats & Conversation Threading

The plugin supports group chats with smart conversation threading -- Claude can follow reply chains, see who said what, and respond in the correct thread.

### Setup

**1. Disable privacy mode in BotFather**

By default, Telegram bots in groups only see commands and messages that mention them. For full thread tracking, disable privacy mode:

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Send `/mybots` → select your bot
3. **Bot Settings** → **Group Privacy** → **Turn off**

> If you prefer to keep privacy mode on, the bot will still work -- it just won't see messages that don't mention it, so thread tracking will be incomplete.

**2. Add the bot to a group**

Add your bot to any Telegram group like a normal member.

**3. Pair the group (automatic)**

Just send a message in the group mentioning your bot (e.g. `@your_bot hello`). The bot replies with a 6-character pairing code -- same flow as DM pairing:

```
/telegram:access pair <code>
```

That's it. The group is registered automatically with `requireMention: true` (bot only responds when mentioned or replied to).

To let it respond to all messages:

```
/telegram:access group update -100XXXXXXXXXX requireMention false
```

> **Manual alternative:** If you already know the group's numeric ID (starts with `-100...`), you can register directly with `/telegram:access group add -100XXXXXXXXXX`. Ways to find the ID: check the bot's stderr logs, open [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org) (ID is in the URL), or forward a group message to [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot).

**4. Restart Claude Code**

```sh
claude --channels plugin:telegram@claude-plugins-official
```

### How Threading Works

- When someone replies to a message in the group, Claude receives `reply_to_text` and `reply_to_user` showing what was replied to
- The plugin tracks up to 200 messages per chat (4-hour TTL) and walks reply chains up to 3 levels deep, providing `thread_context` in the notification
- Claude's own sent messages are tracked too, so reply chains work end-to-end
- Claude automatically threads its responses to the message that triggered them

### Forum Topics

If your supergroup has **Topics** enabled, the plugin forwards `thread_id` (Telegram's `message_thread_id`) and passes it through to replies -- keeping conversations in their correct Forum topic automatically. Topic IDs are persisted in SQLite so context is preserved across restarts.

## Access Control

Full access control docs in [ACCESS.md](./ACCESS.md) -- DM policies, groups, mention detection, delivery config, skill commands, and the `access.json` schema.

Quick reference: Default policy is `pairing` -- DMs and groups both use the pairing flow. For DMs, message the bot to get a code. For groups, add the bot and mention it to get a code. Then `/telegram:access pair <code>` approves either. `ackReaction` only accepts Telegram's fixed emoji whitelist.

## Message History Buffer

Every message flowing through the bot is captured in a local SQLite database and persisted across restarts. Claude gets context without asking users to repeat themselves.

```
~/.claude/channels/telegram/data/messages.db
```

**How it works:**
- A grammY middleware intercepts ALL messages (including group messages without @bot mention) before the gate check
- Both inbound messages and bot replies are stored with `INSERT OR REPLACE` dedup
- Last 5 messages are auto-injected into each notification so Claude always has rolling context
- `get_history` retrieves up to 200 messages with pagination; `search_messages` does substring search
- SQLite WAL mode ensures crash-safe writes -- if Claude Code crashes, the DB auto-recovers on next startup
- Rolling buffer prunes automatically: 500 messages/chat cap, 14-day TTL, 50MB hard limit

## Limitations

Telegram's Bot API exposes **no native history endpoint** -- bots only see messages in real-time. We solve this with a local SQLite message store (see [Message History](#message-history-buffer) below). Every message flowing through the bot is captured and persisted, giving Claude full context across restarts via `get_history` and `search_messages` tools. History is available from when the bot joined the chat.

Photos and voice messages are downloaded eagerly on arrival -- there's no way to fetch attachments from historical messages via the Bot API.
